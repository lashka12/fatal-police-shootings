# fatal-police-shootings

The Washington Post is compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015.
In 2015, The Post began tracking more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. The Post conducted additional reporting in many cases. (source : https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)

we built a various data visualizations and charts using d3.js that helps normal people to understand the data , and maybe allowing scientists to find patterns in the data.
all of the charts can be filtered to highlight a specific feature .
